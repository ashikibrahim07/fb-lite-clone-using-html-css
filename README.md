## About

Facebook Lite Clone is a simplified version of Facebook Lite designed using ONLY HTML and CSS. It aims to provide essential functionalities similar to Facebook Lite, such as basic navigation, a news feed, friends management, messaging, notifications, video watching, and shopping, all within a lightweight and responsive web interface. The project serves as a learning exercise in web development, demonstrating the creation of a functional web application without the need for complex server-side programming or external libraries/frameworks.

## Features

- **Basic Navigation**: The clone replicates the navigation bar found in Facebook Lite, allowing users to easily switch between different sections of the application.
- **Home Page with News Feed**: Users can view a sample news feed containing posts and updates from friends, similar to the experience on Facebook Lite.
- **Friends Page**: Users can manage their friends and view friend requests in a dedicated section of the application.
- **Messenger Page**: Users can exchange messages with friends using a simple messaging interface, mimicking the messaging functionality of Facebook Lite.
- **Notifications**: Users receive notifications for various activities, such as friend requests and post likes, which they can view in a centralized notifications page.
- **Video Page**: Users can watch sample videos within the application, providing entertainment and engagement similar to the video-watching experience on Facebook Lite.
- **Shopping Page**: Users can explore products and items for sale in a dedicated shopping section, enhancing the functionality and utility of the application.
